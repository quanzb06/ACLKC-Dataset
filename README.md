# ACLKC-Dataset: A Large-Scale Dataset for Citation Knowledge Contribution

This repository hosts the **ACLKC-Dataset**, the largest and most comprehensive dataset for Knowledge Contribution Classification in the field of Computational Linguistics.

The dataset includes **802,202** citation contexts systematically collected from the ACL Anthology, covering **45 years** of research (1980-2024). Each instance is automatically classified into one of four distinct knowledge contribution types.

## 🚀 Download the Dataset

The complete dataset (802,202 instances) is available as a single compressed ZIP file (`ACLKC-Dataset.zip`, 330.5 MB) on our **Releases page**.

## Knowledge Contribution Framework

Our classification framework (ACL-KCT) moves beyond subjective citation intent to focus on the objective, verifiable knowledge contribution of a cited paper. We define four categories, including three **Core Knowledge Contributions** and one **Non-core** contribution.

| Contribution Type | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Method** (Core) | Citation where the citing paper ("we") directly uses, implements, improves, or extends methods, techniques, algorithms, models, systems, or evaluation metrics from the cited paper. | "We compute COMET scores [CITATION] separately for each domain with default wmt20-comet-da..." |
| **Resource Tool** (Core) | Citation where the citing paper ("we") uses datasets, corpora, or explicitly labeled toolkits/toolboxes from the cited paper. | "We first extracted opinionated and objective texts from DeReKo corpus [CITATION]" |
| **Empirical Findings** (Core) | Citation providing specific, verifiable empirical findings (results, data) used for: 1) direct comparison, 2) justifying decisions, or 3) stating empirical facts. | "Table 2 shows that... our parser first outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentator of [CITATION]" |
| **Research Background** (Non-core) | Citation providing necessary context by: 1) outlining the developmental course or 2) describing the research landscape. It is descriptive rather than operational. | "Contemporary MT evaluation measures have evolved beyond simple lexical matching... [CITATION1], [CITATION2]" |

## Dataset Overview (802,202 Instances)

Figure 1 shows the statistical features of the 802,202 citation instances. The data shows an exponential growth in publications (Fig. 1a), a high concentration of citations in the *Introduction* (44.0%) and *Related Work* (34.3%) sections (Fig. 1b), and a normal distribution of context length (Mean: 434 chars) (Fig. 1c).

## Gold Standard & Annotation Quality (2,000 Samples)

A 2,000-instance gold standard set was manually annotated to train and validate our models. The annotation quality was rigorously assessed, achieving an **Average Cohen's Kappa of 0.770** and a **Fleiss' Kappa of 0.770** (Fig. 2a, 2b), indicating "excellent" inter-annotator agreement. The distribution of this gold set is shown in Fig. 2c and 2d.

## ACLKC Dataset Analysis (Full 802,202 Instances)

### Full Dataset Distribution

The full dataset provides a macro-level view of the NLP field, composed of **39.09% Core Contributions** (Method, Resource, Finding) and **60.91% Non-core Contributions** (Background).

<p align="center">
  <img width="5727" height="2982" alt="Figure 3: Dataset Distribution" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f3e96c6-1312-4d8e-b8d8-7f99da70de35" />
  <br>
  <em>Figure 3: Distribution Characteristics and Statistical Properties of the ACLKC Dataset</em>
</p>

* **Class Distribution (Fig. 3a/c):** `Background` (60.91%) is the largest class, followed by `Method` (17.66%), `Evidential Finding` (14.75%), and `Resource Tool` (6.68%).
* **Citation Frequency (Fig. 3b):** Core contributions (`Method`, `Evidential Finding`) are significantly more prevalent in high-frequency citations (>10), while `Background` dominates low-frequency citations (1-2).
* **Section (Fig. 3d):** `Background` contributions are concentrated in the *Introduction* (77.42%) and *Related Work* (87.12%) sections.

### Temporal Evolution and Dynamics

The dataset reveals clear trends in how NLP research has evolved over 45 years.

  <br>
  <em>Figure 4: Temporal Evolution and Citation Dynamics in the ACLKC Dataset</em>
</p>

* **Contribution Share (Fig. 4a):** The share of `Resource Tool` contributions has steadily grown from <1% in the 1980s to over 8.5% by 2024, highlighting the shift towards a data-driven, resource-intensive paradigm.
* **Citation Lag (Fig. 4c):** `Evidential Finding` citations are the most time-sensitive, with 50% occurring within 2 years of publication. `Method` and `Resource Tool` contributions show a longer citation lag, indicating their enduring value as part of the field's technical infrastructure.
* **Core vs. Non-core (Fig. 4d):** The growth of both core and non-core contributions has accelerated, with core contributions showing a particularly sharp increase in the pre-training and LLM eras.
